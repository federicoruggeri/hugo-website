# Federico Ruggeri's Website

Hello There! (~cit)

Welcome to my personal website where you can find about my academic research, papers, teaching activities, programming tools, and various modding stuff. 

Cheers!

## Credits

This repository contains a [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) template to create a personal academic website. 

The template uses the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) but modifies it in various ways to be more minimalist and better suited for academic websites. 

The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).
